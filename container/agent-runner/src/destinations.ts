/**
 * Destination map — lives in inbound.db's `destinations` table.
 *
 * The host writes this table before every container wake AND on demand

 * queries the table live on every lookup, so admin changes take effect
 * immediately — no restart required.
 *
 * This table is BOTH the routing map and the container-visible ACL.
 * The host re-validates on the delivery side against the central DB,
 * so even if this table is stale the host's enforcement is authoritative.
